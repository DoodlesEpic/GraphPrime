Graph Prime Calculator is a cross-platform prime number calculator developed on Tauri to simultaneously allow beautiful graphs, excellent performance, and code-sharing between platforms. The frontend "framework" of choice is Svelte for simplicity's sake.

The web view displays the beautiful SVG graphs generated by frappe while the whole calculation runs on the excellent-performing rust backend. The application is currently available for all desktop platforms and will be available for the web and mobile as soon as Tauri enables those options.
